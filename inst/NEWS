1.7.1: Fixed a bug with method peakPloidy when called with method='density'
1.3.5: Added function 'arms' which return name of chromosome and its arm.
    Segmentation can be now done within chromosome arms. The segmentation will not 
    go across centromeres
1.3.4: Fixed an issue with "chr9" which was not segmented. Apparently it is a bug
    with DNAcopy that will be followed up. (Thanks to Rose Brannon for reporting and documenting it)
1.3.3: Changed the 'pos' getter so that you can now decide to get the start or
    the end of the window. This is still not 100% perfect (assumes costant width
    window and could go over the end of the chromosome), but it is in preparation
    of furhter improvements.
    When plotting only one chromosome, chromosome location is now at nicer (i.e. round)
    locations.
    Added capability to show location of centromeres as vertical dotted lines. 
1.3.1: Much improved control over graphical elements of method plotGenome.
    Properties of nearly every color, symbol, line etc can now be set by the user
    Fixed a bug when input has NA in Norm.
1.1.8: Fixed plotGenome so that, when fixVaxes = TRUE horizontal lines are drawn even
    if there are no points in a certain area.
1.1.7: Removed arguments 'adjust' and 'n' from plotPeaks as it needs to retrieve the same 
       values used in peakPloidy.
       Added option fixVAxes to plotGenome to fix vertical axes to maxRatio and minRatio 
       Fixed plotGenome so that the line from superimpose = "DNACopy" is
       actually a line and not a series of dots.
       If plotting only one chromosome, instead of plotting chr name, it plots chromosome position.
1.1.6: Added method 'closest' to function peakPloidy for a "standard" normalisation
       Fixed the 'mode' method
       Internal tiding 
1.1.5: Added methods 'median' and 'mode' to to function peakPloidy for a "standard" normalisation
1.1.4: Fixed an error in exportTable which was providing a meaningless value for SegMean
1.1.3: Changed the provided data (LS041 and CN) to match what bam2windows.pl version 0.3.4
1.1.2: Added an option to plot more colorful genome plots 
1.1.1: Corrected a bug in exportTable that crashed if smoothed ratio was not available.
0.1.3.6: Corrected a series of typos in the manual pages and improved the vignette.
0.1.3.5: Added biocViews and specified licence.
0.1.3.4: Added data object CN after peakPloidy is performed.
